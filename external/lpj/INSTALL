Installation of lpj C Version 0.9.025
=====================================

Installation for Unix-like systems
----------------------------------

This text describes how to install lpj on your system. 
The code has been tested for AIX, Linux, and Windows 
with cygwin. Cygwin is a linux like environment for 
Windows (http://www.cygwin.com)

create lpj directory:

mkdir lpj

Go to lpj directory:

cd lpj

untar source and data files

gzip -cd lpj-0.9.025.tar.gz|tar -xf -
gzip -cd cru.tar.gz|tar -xf -

Directory tree after extracting tar files:

--lpj
  |
  +--par        : Parameter files for Pfts and soils
  |
  +--input      : input data sets for climate
  |
  +--output     : output data (created by make test)
  |
  +--lib        : library files (created by make)
  |
  +--include    : include files
  |
  +--src        : source tree
     |
     +--numeric : source for numerical routines
     |
     +--base    : base functionality of lpj
     |
     +--climate : climate code 
     |
     +--lpj     : lpj update functions
     |
     +--soil    : soil code
     |
     +--grass   : grass Pft code
     |
     +--tree    : tree Pft code
         
Configure for your operating system:

./configure.sh

If configure scripts exits with message "Unsupported operating system",
Makefile.$osname is created from Makefile.gcc and probably has to be 
modified for your operating system/compiler.

Create executables:

make all   

Two executable are created: 

lpj    - LPJ simulation code
catlpj - utitility to concatenate restart files

Test lpj with sample lpj.conf file:

make test

The shell script distribute.sh can be used to create *.conf files in order to 
divide the simulation  into pieces:

./distribute.sh <number of pieces> [<number of grid cells>]

Installation for Windows XP without cygwin
------------------------------------------

The code has been tested on Windows XP using the free Microsoft C++ compiler
 and nmake. The compiler can be obtained from 
http://msdn.microsoft.com/visualc/vctoolkit2003/
To compile with the cpp preprocessing of the configutation/data files enabled, 
the Microsoft SDK is needed. It can be downloaded from the Microsoft server.


Unzip the source and data files

configure makefile:

configure.bat

create lpj executable:

nmake 


By default lpj does not use the cpp preprocessor. .conf files have to be 
preprocessed by invoking 

cl /ep filename.conf

Preprocessing can be enabled by compiling with the -DUSE_CPP flag in 
Makefile.inc
